## Welcome

- ES1: The learner develops a comprehensive guide of instructional strategies, categorizing them according to different learning science principles and explaining how each strategy facilitates effective learning.

- ES2: The learner analyzes several case studies of classroom instruction, identifying the learning science principles at play and evaluating the effectiveness of the instructional strategies used.

- ES3: The learner designs a series of lesson plans, each incorporating a different learning science principle, and justifies how these principles are expected to enhance learning outcomes.

- ES4: The learner conducts a workshop for educators, demonstrating and explaining various instructional strategies grounded in learning science, and discussing their practical applications.

- ES5: The learner writes a research paper comparing traditional instructional strategies with those based on learning science, providing evidence of the impact on student learning.

- ES7: The learner participates in a debate, defending the use of specific learning science principles in instructional design and their potential to improve learning outcomes.

- ES8: The learner develops an assessment tool for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of their instructional strategies in light of learning science principles.

- ES9: The learner collaborates with peers to design an innovative instructional strategy or tool, grounded in learning science, and pilot tests it in a classroom setting, analyzing its impact.

- ES10: The learner reflects on their own teaching or learning experiences, identifying instances where learning science principles were effectively or ineffectively applied, and proposes improvements.
