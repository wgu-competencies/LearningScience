In this initial section, we aim to introduce students to the fascinating world of the neuroscience of learning. The neuroscience of learning is a multidisciplinary field that explores how the brain learns and absorbs information.
One of the primary objectives of this section is to debunk common neuromyths using scientific research. Neuromyths are misconceptions about brain functioning and learning that are unfortunately widespread in society and even in educational settings. These myths often stem from a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of scientific facts.
By debunking these neuromyths, we hope to provide students with a more accurate understanding of how the brain functions and how learning occurs. This knowledge can then be used to inform more effective learning strategies and teaching practices.
Learning Experience
This section of the course implements a custom sequence, meaning that the order of the lessons and learning experiences is arbitrary. Each lesson follows the structure of presenting a neuromyth, the neuroscience principle that debunks the myth, and an experiential component to help solidify the learning.
The introduction to the course should explain of the format, as well as an infographic advanced organizer or fill-in chart that can help as a cognitive scaffold for the different concepts presented. Something like the chart below, but cooler, and the student should receive it as a blank printable Portable Document Format file (PDF) or a fill-in-the-blank word doc they can complete on their computer.
The learning patterns for this section is Retrieval Practice. The advanced organizer can aid in retrieval.

Here's an example of an completed advanced organizer. It would be ideal if a graphic designer could stylize it to make it look better than a table to fill out, perhaps make it more visual.

| Instructions                               | Describe The   Myth Commonly Held About                                                                                          | What Does the Neuroscience Say?                                                                                               | What   Principles of Neuroscience Help Debunk This Myth?                            | How Could These Principles of   The Neuroscience Change How You Teach?                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Myth 1: Multitasking And   Cramming        | The belief that people can   effectively focus on multiple tasks at once and that cramming is an effective   study method.       | Brains have a limited amount of   attention. Brains forget things. Learning can be reinforced by spacing out   reviews.       | Cognitive Load, Spaced   Repetition                                                 | Emphasize focused, single task   learning and spaced repetition in teaching methods to enhance retention and   understanding.                    |
| Myth 2: Normal People Exist                | The idea that there is a   standard or 'normal' brain functioning everyone should conform to.                                    | Every brain is unique, and what   is considered 'normal' varies widely. People learn and process information   differently.   | Neurodiversity, Multi-sensory   Learning                                            | Recognize and cater to the   diverse learning needs and styles of students, using a variety of teaching   methods.                               |
| Myth 3: A Leopard Can’t Change   Its Spots | The notion that people's   fundamental characteristics, intelligence, or abilities cannot change over   time.                    | The brain is capable of lifelong   learning and adaptation, a concept known as neuroplasticity.                               | Innate Capacities,   Neuroplasticity                                                | Encourage a growth mindset,   focusing on the potential for change and development in students' abilities   and intelligence.                    |
| Myth 4: The Brain Is a computer            | The assumption that the brain   functions like a computer, processing information in a linear, binary, and   predictable manner. | The brain operates in a complex,   non-linear way, influenced by emotions, body states, and environment, unlike   a computer. | The Embodied Mind, Whole Brain   Learning                                           | Teach in a way that acknowledges   the holistic nature of learning, integrating emotional and experiential   elements.                           |
| Myth 5: Some People Are Born   “Great”     | The belief that certain   individuals are innately destined for greatness due to their genetics or   early life conditions.      | Success and expertise are often   the result of hard work, practice, and learning, rather than innate talent   alone.         | Growth Mindset, Desirable   Difficulty, Zone of Proximal Development, Antifragility | Foster a learning environment   that values effort, challenges, and resilience, encouraging students to   develop beyond their perceived limits. |
