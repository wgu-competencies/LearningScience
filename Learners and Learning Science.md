## Course Intro

### Welcome to Learners and Learning Science

### What you need to pass the test

- 

## Examines Principles of Neuroscience

- ES1: The learner effectively identifies and explains key principles of neuroscience, such as neuroplasticity, and demonstrates how these principles inform specific instructional strategies.
- ES2: The learner analyzes case studies of educational practices, identifying where and how neuroscience principles are applied or could enhance learning outcomes.
- ES3: The learner designs a lesson plan that incorporates neuroscience principles, clearly articulating how these principles support learning objectives.
- ES4: The learner critiques existing instructional methods by evaluating their alignment with neuroscience research, suggesting improvements based on neurological evidence.
- ES5: The learner conducts a small-scale research project, gathering and analyzing data on how the application of neuroscience principles impacts student engagement and learning.
- ES6: The learner creates a portfolio of educational resources (e.g., articles, videos, lesson plans) that demonstrate the application of neuroscience in various educational settings.
- ES7: The learner participates in a discussion forum, articulately defending the importance of neuroscience in education and providing examples of its effective application.
- ES8: The learner develops a presentation that synthesizes neuroscience research, demonstrating its relevance and application in contemporary instructional practices.
- ES9: The learner writes a reflective essay on their personal experience with instructional practices influenced by neuroscience, discussing both successes and challenges.
- ES10: The learner constructs a concept map that visually connects key neuroscience concepts with a range of instructional strategies, showing an understanding of the interplay between the two.

### Behaviorism

### Cognitivism

### Constructivism

### Humanism

### Socio-cultural

## Analyzes Impact of Diversity and Individuality

- ES1: The learner conducts a detailed analysis of case studies demonstrating how sensitivity to cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic diversity in the classroom enhances student learning outcomes.

- ES2: The learner designs a diverse classroom curriculum that includes materials and content reflective of various cultures, abilities, and backgrounds, explaining how these elements cater to different learning styles and needs.

- ES3: The learner creates a portfolio showcasing adaptations of instructional strategies to meet the needs of students from diverse backgrounds, including those with special educational needs.

- ES4: The learner writes a research paper exploring the impact of teacher awareness of diversity on student engagement and achievement, supported by empirical evidence.

- ES5: The learner develops and administers a survey to educators and students, gathering data on perceptions of diversity in learning environments and its impact on student engagement.

- ES6: The learner presents a series of lesson plans that demonstrate differentiated instruction techniques to accommodate diverse learning styles and abilities.

- ES7: The learner participates in a role-playing exercise, demonstrating effective communication and teaching strategies for a classroom with diverse learners.

- ES8: The learner critiques a current educational policy or practice, evaluating its effectiveness in addressing the needs of a diverse student population and suggesting improvements.

- ES9: The learner reflects on their own biases and assumptions in a written essay, discussing how increased awareness and sensitivity can positively impact their teaching practices.

- ES10: The learner collaborates in a group project to design an inclusive school program or initiative that addresses the needs of a diverse student body, explaining the rationale and expected outcomes.

### The Myth of Normal

## Recommend an Instructional Strategy

- ES1: The learner develops a comprehensive guide of instructional strategies, categorizing them according to different learning science principles and explaining how each strategy facilitates effective learning.

- ES2: The learner analyzes several case studies of classroom instruction, identifying the learning science principles at play and evaluating the effectiveness of the instructional strategies used.

- ES3: The learner designs a series of lesson plans, each incorporating a different learning science principle, and justifies how these principles are expected to enhance learning outcomes.

- ES4: The learner conducts a workshop for educators, demonstrating and explaining various instructional strategies grounded in learning science, and discussing their practical applications.

- ES5: The learner writes a research paper comparing traditional instructional strategies with those based on learning science, providing evidence of the impact on student learning.

- ES7: The learner participates in a debate, defending the use of specific learning science principles in instructional design and their potential to improve learning outcomes.

- ES8: The learner develops an assessment tool for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of their instructional strategies in light of learning science principles.

- ES9: The learner collaborates with peers to design an innovative instructional strategy or tool, grounded in learning science, and pilot tests it in a classroom setting, analyzing its impact.

- ES10: The learner reflects on their own teaching or learning experiences, identifying instances where learning science principles were effectively or ineffectively applied, and proposes improvements.
